Folding-at-home installer for Linux

This is a simple playbook to install and configure the Folding-at-Home client on Linux hosts, using systemd.

Right now, it is just tested on RHEL 8, but I hope to add other platforms, soon.

To get started, just fill out the variables in the inventory, at minimum, the list of hosts to install on. All other variables are optional.

Please fork, send PRs, and open issues, as needed.
